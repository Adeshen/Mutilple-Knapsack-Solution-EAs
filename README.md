# GA-SA-Knapsack

An implementation of the  genetic algorithm  and simulated annealing (IGA-SA) algorithm applied to the mutiple knapsack  problem and the knapsack 0-1 problem




### Run

```bash
python main_mutiple_knapSack.py
```

it will run a litte demo that describe how to change MKP to 0-1 KP

```bash
python main.py
```

it will run a procedure to run out with all dataset

### Prerequisites

* python 3.6.x
* numpy
* matplotlib

### Acknowledgments

This is a implement for my course SSE intelligent algorithm.

Hybrid Algorithm based on the algorithm presented in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-007-9209-5)
